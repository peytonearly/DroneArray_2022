# Drone Array Project

## Created by:
Peyton Early  
Tyler Kirkpatrick

# Detailed Plan/Schedule
## Phase 1: Research and Design
- Quadrotor chassis
- Electronics/wiring configuration
- Aerodynamic stability and control analysis

## Phase 2: Fabrication, Testing, and Redesigning
- Fabricate chassis
- Test controls implementation (refine as necessary)
- Test and refine eletronics systems

## Phase 3: Synchronization Design
- Determination of synchronization method (bluetooth, rf, wifi, etc.)
- Implement "ground" system as hub for drone synchronization

## Phase 4: Expanded Production and Synchronization Implementation
- Produce more units based on final design
- Test synchronization method
